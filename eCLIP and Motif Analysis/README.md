Flanking introns were defined as up to 500 bps upstream for exons with no annotated coding regions overlapping. 

eCLIP peaks were called from ENCODE data using logFC â‰¥ 3 and p-value <0.001 cutoffs.

Motif enrichment (7 bps) was similarly analyzed using the RBPamp model from Marvin Jens: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.08.515616v1
