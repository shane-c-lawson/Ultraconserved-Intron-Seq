Vex-seq analysis of 3 ultraconserved NMD exons was performed using single nucleotide mutations across the alloted intron/exon regions as well as 6 bp deletions.

Vex-seq RNA-seq data was processed using scripts adapted from Scott Adamson: https://github.com/scottiadamson/Vex-seq

Variant exon/intron splicing analysis was conducted using constructs designed from the sequences detailed in Primers+Ultramers.xlsx and validated by CRISPR.
