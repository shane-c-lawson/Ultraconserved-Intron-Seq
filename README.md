# Ultraconserved-Intron-Seq

Vex-seq analysis of 3 ultraconserved NMD exons was performed using single nucleotide mutations across the alloted intron/exon regions as well as 6 bp deletions.

Vex-seq RNAseq data was process using scripts adapted Scott Adamson: from https://github.com/scottiadamson/Vex-seq

Conserved NMD exons and exons with distant intronic conservation were analyzed for eCLIP peak/motif enrichment as well as splicing rates and branchpoint locations.
