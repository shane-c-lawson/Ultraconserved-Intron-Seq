# Ultraconserved Intron Seq

Exons with extended flanking intron conservation were bioinformatically predicted and analyzed for sequence features and splicing behavior.  
Computational analysis and branchpoint identification is detailed in "Ultraconserved intron analysis"  
Experimental splicing assays and branchpoint sequencing/CRISPR is detailed in "Vex-seq analysis"
